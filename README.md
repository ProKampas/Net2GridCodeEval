Net2GridCodeEval

This Project is the Coding Evaluation Test that was given to me for implementation by the Net2Grid Analytics Team.
It utilizes many different technologies, like Java 11, the use of GitKraken, Maven and JUnit for testing.

The project comprises of 3 subprojects and 3 bonuses. Each subproject is essentially the implementation of a class. 
The classes implement some calculations of Statistical Metrics as well as the Ascending Minima Algorithm. 

The bonuses attempt to improve the above subprojects and add further functionality.
